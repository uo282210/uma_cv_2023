    "# 4.1 Corner detection and description. Harris and NCC\n",
    "\n",
    "As you are learning throughout this book, images are highly valuable sources of information about the environment. That is why the use of cameras is becoming mainstream in a wider and wider set of real world applications such as robotics, autonomous cars, security, augmented and virtual reality, industrial inspection, etc. As you also know, images must be processed in order to obtain (compact) information about their content. For example, in the previous chapter you learned how to detect edges in an image, which give us information, for example, about the contours of the objects in the scene. \n",
    "\n",
    "In general, there exist different types of elements of interest that can be extracted from the images such as *corners*, *blobs*, *edges*, etc., each of them with different properties. This elements are collectively called **image features**. In this chapter we will address one of the most common approaches for extracting information from images, namely **keypoint detection** (i.e. finding *interesting* pixels, or points, in the image). The term *interesting* would depend on the application.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this first notebook we will focus on detecting (and describing) **corners**: image points with high variation of intensity in two spatial directions. Concretely, we will cover corner detection using the well-known and widely used **Harris corner detector** (<a href=\"#411\">section 4.1.1</a>). \n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to remark that the output of such detector are just the **positions** of the corners in the images (that's the purpose of a **detector**, actually). So, in order to be able to distinguish between different corners, we have to incorporate some kind of information about the *appearance* of the keypoint, which will be useful to match corresponding corners in different images. This is called the **description** of the corner. In this sense, we are going to explore how to use a patch around the keypoint as the descriptor, and employ the so-called **Normalized Cross-Correlation** (NCC) to find such matches (<a href=\"#412\">section 4.1.2</a>). Finally, we will put these techniques to work together in <a href=\"#413\">section 4.1.3</a>."

    "\n",
    "One important thing to understand is that after extracting the keypoints, you only obtain information about their position. While this information might be enough for some applications (e.g. counting corners), it does not say much about the keypoints themselves. For example, in applications where you need to match keypoints, that is, identify the correspondence of one keypoint in an image with those in the other one, to know the pixel location is not enough. \n",
    "\n",
    "This reveals the need to **describe** such keypoints, and **match** them according to these descriptions. The simplest descriptor is to consider the intensity of the pixels surrounding a keypoint, i.e. to extract **a patch of the image** with the keypoint at its center. But, how to match keypoints according to these patches?\n",
    "\n",
    "At this point is where the **Normalized Cross-Correlation (NCC)** technique could help. Computing the NCC is similar to applying a convolution, i.e. a sliding window (the image patch, template, or kernel) is applied to an image. Unlike in the convolution case, NCC does not flip the kernel/patch. $\\\\[5pt]$\n",
